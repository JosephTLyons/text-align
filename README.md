# Text Align
An [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor package that left, center, and right
aligns text between the left side of the editor and the Preferred Line Length
setting.

Here are some examples of using the "Center Align" option:

## Before Centering Single Line

## Description:

* This package aims to be useful when aligning items in academic papers, but you
may find other uses for it.
* If no selection is made, text on the line of the cursor is aligned.  
* If a selection is made, all lines of text containing the selection
will be aligned.

## Future Features:

## Bug(s):

* Not working with certain elements in code files (like ending brackets and
braces), however, I don't see many people using it in code.  At any rate, I will
try to fix this.

## TODO:

* Work on efficiency of algorithm
* Clean up algorithm
* Add new pictures to demonstrate other alignment options

## Notes:

* You will not find v0.1.0 at all.  v0.1.0 relates to an earlier version of this
package called `center-align` and is no longer published.
