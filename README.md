# Center Align

## Description:

* An Atom text editor package that center aligns text between the left side of
the text editor and the preferredLineLength.  If a selection is made, all text
within the selection will be centered, if no selection is made, text on the line
of the cursor is centered.

## Future Features:

## Bug(s)

* Not working with certain elements in code (like brackets and braces)

## TODO:

* Add a .gif or before and after photos showing the action before publishing
* Is there a way to implement this where undoing it will only take one command
z?
