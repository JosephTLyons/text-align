# Center Align

## Description:

* An Atom text editor package that center aligns text between the left side of
the text editor and the preferredLineLength.  If a selection is made, all text
within the selection will be centered, if no selection is made, text on the line
of the cursor is centered.  This is most useful when centering items in academic
papers, such as titles and works cited headings, but it can be used to center
align entire documents of text as well.

## Future Features:

* Currently, there is no way to "batch undo" this.  If there is a way to do
this, please let me know.  If I can't figure out an elegant solution, I may have
to include some sort of left-justify algorithm to undo it.

## Bug(s)

* Not working with certain elements in code (like brackets and braces)

## TODO:

* Add a .gif or before and after photos showing the action before publishing
* Find a way to implement this where undoing it will only take one command z
