# Text Align
An [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor package that left, center, and right
aligns text between the left side of the editor and the Preferred Line Length
setting.

Here are some examples of using the "Center Align" option:

## Before Centering Single Line

## Description:

* If no selection is made, text on the line of the cursor is aligned.  
* If a selection is made, all text within the selection will be aligned.
* This package is most useful when aligning items in academic papers.

## Future Features:

## Bug(s):

* Not working with certain elements in code files (like ending brackets and
braces), however, I don't see many people using it in code.  At any rate, I will
try to fix this.

## TODO:

* Work on efficiency of algorithm
* Clean up algorithm
* Add new pictures to demonstrate other alignment options
