## Description:

* If no selection is made, text on the line of the cursor is centered.  
* If a selection is made, all text within the selection will be centered.
* This is most useful when centering items in academic papers, such as titles
and works cited headings, but it can be used to center align entire documents of
text as well.

## Future Features:

## Bug(s)

* Not working with certain elements in code files (like ending brackets and
braces), however, I don't see many people using it in code.  At any rate, I will
try to fix this.

## TODO:

* Work on efficiency of algorithm
