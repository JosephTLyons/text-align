## Description:

* If no selection is made, text on the line of the cursor is aligned.  
* If a selection is made, all text within the selection will be aligned.
* This package is most useful when aligning items in academic papers.

## Future Features:

## Bug(s):

* Not working with certain elements in code files (like ending brackets and
braces), however, I don't see many people using it in code.  At any rate, I will
try to fix this.

## TODO:

* Work on efficiency of algorithm
* Clean up algorithm
* Add new pictures to showcase other alignment options
* Add other options to activationCommands in package.json
* Fix bug where commands and such don't work right away after opening atom
* Publish to atom.io
