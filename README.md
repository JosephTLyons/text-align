# Center Align


## Description:

* An Atom text editor package that center aligns text between the left side of the text editor and the preferredLineLength (currently only centers the line of text that the cursor is on).

## Future Features:

* Will center all lines within a selection and not just one single line

## Bug(s)

* None currently?

## TODO:

* Figure out how to rename context menu label
* Add a .gif or before and after photos showing the action
