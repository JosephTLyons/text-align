# Center Align


## Description:

* An Atom text editor package that center aligns text between the left side of
the text editor and the preferredLineLength (currently only centers the line
of text that the cursor is on).

## Future Features:

* Center all lines within a selection and not just one single line

## Bug(s)

* None currently?

## TODO:

* Features
* Add a .gif or before and after photos showing the action before publishing
* Is there a way to implement this where undoing it will only take one command
z?
